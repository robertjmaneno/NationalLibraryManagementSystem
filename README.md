# National Library Management System (NLMS)

## Overview
The *National Library Management System (NLMS)* is a modular platform designed for efficient library management. It consists of two microservices:

- *National Library Core Service*: Manages staff, members, lending transactions, and reporting.
- *Catalogue Management Service*: Handles cataloging library resources like books, newspapers, articles, and more.

These services work together to provide seamless operations and resource tracking for the library system.

## Prerequisites
Before running the system, ensure the following software and configurations are installed:

1. *.NET 8*: Install the latest version.
2. *MongoDB*: Ensure MongoDB is installed and running locally (localhost).
3. *MS SQL Server*: Install and configure locally.
4. *SQL Server Management Studio*: Use to manage your SQL Server databases.
5. *Database Import*:
   - Import NationalLibraryCoreServiceDb.bacpac into your local MS SQL Server to populate sample data for the Core Service.
6. *Catalogue Management Service Initialization*:
   - On the first run, the service automatically creates a database with sample data.
